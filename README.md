# Schoology
i want to check my grades faster

## todo
- set up postgres
- look over the [documentation](https://developers.schoology.com/api-documentation/authentication)
- make a user model so we don't have to do so much postgres stuff
- save schoology data from /me into postgres (e.g. user id)
- maybe spin off api into separate module
- should id be a part of the schema?
- or at least a property on the class?
